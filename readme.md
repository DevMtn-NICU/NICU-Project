Share Heart-to-Heart
============

A DevMountain group project designed to normalize the experience of parents with babies in a NICU unit. The app allows parents to share their baby's pictures, statistics, test results, etc. with family and close friends. This project was built as a donation for the University of Utah NICU unit, but could be implemented for other hospitals and even other types of isolated medical units.

##How it works

The site is intended to be managed by a hospital and its staff. Nurses stationed in the NICU will have their own portal to routinely input information and pictures for babies, which will then show up in a separate portal designed for parents. After logging in, parents will receive the latest updates on their baby's condition, consisting of statistics, pictures, comments, graphs, and timelines. Parents will then be able to add family and friends to their tiered security access list, after which those individuals will be able to log in and view a feed specifically tailored to their individual security level.
